Projects and coursework from my time in CS-330 at SNHU.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I approach designing software by analyzing the requirements, breaking the problem into smaller tasks, and creating modular, reusable components. I prioritize clarity and scalability in the design to accommodate future changes.  

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**  
Working on this project improved my ability to design engaging visual layouts and manage object interactions effectively, such as using dynamic behaviors for enhanced user engagement.  

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**  
I followed an iterative design process, starting with a simple structure and refining it through testing and feedback. Each iteration added features while ensuring compatibility with the overall design.  

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**  
Tactics like modular design and iterative refinement can be applied to future projects, ensuring flexibility and the ability to adapt to new requirements.  

**How do I approach developing programs?**  
I approach developing programs by writing modular, well-documented code and testing frequently to ensure functionality at each stage.  

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**  
This project introduced me to complex 3D shape rendering, texturing, and the Phong lighting model, which were each crucial for enhancing the 3D scene.  

**How did iteration factor into your development?**  
Iteration was key in development, as repeated testing and refinement helped identify and resolve issues while adding incremental improvements.  

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**  
My approach has evolved to emphasize planning and modularity, making the code easier to debug, enhance, and extend.  

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**  
Computer science provides tools to solve complex problems efficiently, enabling me to reach my academic and professional goals by applying logical and creative thinking.  

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**  
Computational graphics have given me skills in visual problem-solving and design, which are directly applicable to future projects in both educational and professional contexts.  

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**  
These skills prepare me for careers in fields like game development, simulation design, or data visualization, where interactive and visually compelling designs are highly valued.
